# A metadata convention for processed acoustic data from active acoustic systems

This directory contains the text, source files, and utilities that are necessary to generate the AcMeta convention document. It is also the place where new versions of the convention are discussed and developed.

Version 1.10 of the AcMeta convention (as ICES SISP 4-TG-AcMeta) is available [here](https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/ICES%20Survey%20Protocols%20(SISP)/SISP-4%20A%20metadata%20convention%20for%20processed%20acoustic%20data%20from%20active%20acoustic%20systems.pdf).
