== Background and Terms of reference
:sectnums:

The ICES Working Group on Fisheries Acoustics, Science and Technology (WGFAST) meeting in 2010, San Diego USA recommended the formation of a Topic Group that will bring together a group of expert acousticians to develop standardised metadata protocols for active acoustic systems. Through annual meetings in 2011-2013 and email correspondence the Topic Group on Acoustic Metadata (TG-AcMeta) developed a metadata convention for active acoustic data which is presented in this document.

The terms of reference for TG-AcMeta were "`To develop standardised metadata protocols to suit requirements for data acquisition, processing, quality control and data dissemination of calibrated integrated active acoustic backscatter data. This includes data from a range of platforms such as Ships of Opportunity including research, merchant and commercial fishing vessels, moorings, AUV's and acoustic instruments such as calibrated single- and multi-beam acoustic systems.`"


== Purpose of this document

Metadata is data describing data, and should allow potential users to determine the fitness for their purposes of that data from the metadata alone, without having to access the actual data. A metadata convention is a systematic set of metadata attributes that have been developed to describe a particular genre or type of data. This document describes a metadata convention that details the attribute fields necessary to describe water column backscatter data obtained from active acoustic systems.

This convention is not intended to conform to general metadata standards, such as FGDC, ISO:19115/19139, etc., nor to describe a metadata profile consistent with such standards. Essentially it describes a set of attributes to be included with the acoustic data itself to make a fully self-documenting data set. In addition to these, it also defines best practice for storing and managing fisheries acoustic data by providing a standard approach. That said, the metadata elements described here include all those necessary to populate any aggregated (or even global) metadata catalogue describing the available bioacoustic datasets managed in multiple institutional repositories.

It is recommended that processed acoustic data is stored in SI units of linear s~v~ (m^-1^). Depending on the purpose, acoustic backscattering data is sometimes stored in a number of other forms including S~v~, volume backscatter in logarithmic form (dB re 1m^-1^), area backscattering coefficient s~a~ (m^2^ m^-2^), or scaled to nautical area scattering coefficient, s~A~ (aka NASC, m^2^ nmi^-2^) cite:[maclennan2002]. The actual form of the backscattering data needs to be specified as part of the data attributes and the dimensions of the echo integration cell also specified.

This convention was developed for processed acoustic data, but has relevance for archiving raw acoustic data. Processed acoustic backscatter data are generated by applying procedures to the instrument acquired acoustic data (i.e., raw data) that address data quality and calibration and, in many cases, resampling to a lower resolution than the acquired data. Unless stated otherwise in the metadata, appropriate calibration offsets and time varied gain (TVG) corrections will have been applied. Metadata attribute fields are provided that will allow description of processing procedures specific to the data set.

In many cases the cost of collecting acoustic data is significant and adhering to this metadata convention will facilitate the discovery, reuse, and exchange of processed acoustic data while ensuring its longevity.

== Global attributes

The metadata attribute fields in this document build on existing conventions and are presented following the netCDF (network Common Data Format) cite:[rew1990,unidata2017] format of global attributes. The global attributes describe the overall contents of the file and allow for data discovery. Global attributes can be thought of as conveying five kinds of information:

* What: What are the data in the dataset?

* Where: The spatial coverage of the data.

* When: The temporal coverage of the data.

* Who: Who produced the data?

* How: How were the data produced and how are they being made available?


All fields should be human-readable and can be of either '`character`' or '`numeric`' type. Where applicable, metadata attribute definitions will state that controlled vocabulary should be used. Use of controlled vocabulary aids consistency, accuracy, interoperability, and data discovery. Standard lists for controlled vocabulary developed specifically for this metadata convention are given in <<_standard_lists_for_controlled_vocabulary>>. If the appropriate words are not present in the standard list users should provide their own terminology. The standard lists can be extended according to user feedback to accommodate new terminologies in future versions of this metadata convention.

Wherever possible, the global attributes are based on established authorities. In some instances the metadata attribute may cite other authorities, while other metadata attributes may be unique to this metadata convention. Where they exist, the relevant authority is cited for each of the attribute fields. A table of the various metadata authorities is given in <<_metadata_authorities>>.

The metadata attributes are grouped according to logical categories. This is done to help both author and reader navigate the metadata record, but it is important to note that this does not describe a formal hierarchical structure. The metadata record of this convention is effectively a continuous list. Thus each global attribute must have a unique name for it to be unambiguously identified. Attribute names that are sourced from existing authorities are by necessity identical to that used by the authority in order to facilitate automatic harvesting of metadata. To ensure uniqueness, non-authoritative attributes are prefixed with the category name of this metadata convention. White spaces or blank characters are not allowed in attribute names as these are not supported by some of the established authorities (e.g. CF, the NetCDF Climate and Forecast Metadata Convention) and the underscore '`_`' character is used instead. Specific categories of ship and mooring attributes have been developed for this current version of the metadata convention. Further development of metadata attribute fields for other acoustic systems (e.g. autonomous underwater vehicles, gliders, towed bodies, acoustic lenses, and parametric arrays) can be developed as required, following the form of existing conventions used in this document.

There is no constraint on the addition of extra metadata attributes to fully describe a dataset. Such extra attributes would be a super-set of the attributes of this convention and might be specific to a particular institution but their presence would not violate this convention.

== Implementation of metadata convention

This document describes a metadata convention for processed acoustic data. It is assumed that appropriate data and metadata management of unprocessed acoustic data files will be in place, discussion of which is beyond the scope of this document.

Processed acoustic data and metadata may be held in a variety of formats including, but not limited to, relational databases, Extensible Markup Language (XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Network Common Data Form (netCDF) and Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). Storage of the data and associated metadata is a question of implementation and is not mandated or defined by this document. When choosing a data format some key considerations are ease of data exchange, visibility of data and metadata, and potential for automated harvesting of metadata. It is recommended that guidance and assistance from metadata experts is sought when realizing this metadata convention in a specific implementation format.

== Summary of metadata categories

*Metadata Record*

Uniform resource identifier (URI) that uniquely identifies the metadata record.

*Mission metadata*

Metadata that gives a high level description of the overarching initiative (e.g. mission, project, ocean observing system) under which the acoustic data were collected.

*Cruise metadata*

Attributes that describe the cruise from which the acoustic data were acquired. Metadata should provide information that readily enables the cruise to be identified and be aware of cruise objectives, other instrumentation, and data acquired.

*Ship metadata*

Attributes that describe the ship from which acoustic data were collected. Metadata should provide information that uniquely identifies the ship and its basic specifications to enable an understanding of the type of ship and its purpose.

*Mooring metadata*

Attributes that describe the mooring from which acoustic data were collected.

*Transect metadata*

Attributes that describe transect data. Transect metadata would normally apply to acoustic data from a moving platform.

*Instrument metadata*

Attributes that describe the acoustic instrument that recorded the raw data from which the processed data were derived.

*Ancillary instruments*

Attributes that provide the opportunity to list ancillary instruments that may be of relevance to the acoustic data set.

*Calibration metadata*

Attributes that describe calibration procedures and calibration accuracy and precision.

*Data acquisition metadata*

Attributes that describe the data acquisition process.

*Data processing metadata*

Attributes that describe the data processing procedures. Data processing procedures may be complex and difficult to capture in a simple list of attributes. Therefore links to documents that give more comprehensive descriptions of processing procedures should be given if appropriate.

*Dataset metadata*

Attributes that describe the set of data. Some attributes will vary with each data file and may be automatically generated from the data file. When possible, automatic generation of dataset attribute metadata is preferred to reduce effort and the possibility of human error. Other attributes will need to be manually generated. In many cases attributes may be unchanged between datasets; hence the use of a metadata template which includes stable attributes may be beneficial.

*Data metadata*

Attributes that describe the data in a dataset, including the type of scattering quantity that is stored and the data horizontal and vertical dimensions.

== Description of metadata category table headers

* *Attribute name*: Unique name for the attribute. When possible, names will conform to existing standards. Non-authoritative attributes are prefixed with the category name to ensure that they are unique. For example the 'name' attribute for cruise and ship categories are prefixed to be cruise_name and ship_name respectively. White space or blank characters are not allowed and the underscore '`_`' character is used instead. For this metadata convention all attribute fields are lowercase.
* *Definition*: Description of attribute.
* *Data type*: S for string, N for numeric
* *Units*: If applicable, the units to be used for numeric attributes, using the SI standard.
* *Authority*: Where they exist, the relevant authority is cited for each of the attribute fields. The field is left blank if no authority exists.
* *Obligation*: Following Dublin Core documentation cite:[dublincore2004], Obligation '`indicates whether the element is required to always or sometimes be present. In this application profile, the obligation can be: mandatory (M), mandatory if applicable (MA), strongly recommended (R) or optional (O). Mandatory ensures that some of the elements are always supported and mandatory if applicable means that this element must be supported if the information is available. An element with a mandatory obligation must have a value. The strongly recommended and the optional elements should be filled with a value if the information is appropriate to the given resource but if not, they may be omitted.`' An example of an MA field would be attributes in the mooring table that are only populated if the data relates to the mooring in some way.
* *Maximum occurrences*: Specifies the maximum number of instances of the attribute. Single occurrences are shown by '`1`'. Multiple, but specified number of occurrences, are indicated by '`N`'. A fixed number of occurrences are allowed (e.g., '`2`', '`3`', etc). For example, if the data comes from a cruise then the attribute field cruise_name is mandatory and applicable and has a maximum occurrence of 1.

=== Category: Data attributes

It is usual and recommended for the cell dimensions (ping-axis interval and range-axis interval) to be stored for each data value to be stored with the data. These cell dimensions should also be defined in the metadata if possible. If cell dimensions do vary within the dataset then they cannot be specified in the metadata record and it will be essential that they are stored with the data. Similarly it is expected that time and position (if appropriate) of each data value will be stored with the data.

[appendix]
== Transducer orientation conventions

This Appendix was reproduced with permission from the Echoview 5.1 help file (see also http://www.echoview.com[www.echoview.com]).

*About transducer geometry*

Transducer geometry in Echoview refers to the configurable location and orientation of http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Reference/Glossary.htm#Transducer[transducers]. This page covers:

* Overview of transducer geometry
* About transducer location
* About transducer orientation

For information about how transducer geometry affects displayed data and exports, see http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Using_Echoview/What_is_effected_by_transducer_geometry.htm[What is affected by transducer geometry].

*Overview of transducer geometry*

Each transducer may be located in space and oriented as desired. Illustrated below is a schematic displaying the relative positions in space of a reference point, a GPS antenna and a transducer with non-vertical orientation. How to define location and orientation for each transducer is described below.

image:image1.png[]

Transducers are always associated with a http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Reference/Glossary.htm#Platform[platform]. The reference point of the platform is at (0,0,0) by definition and defines the position of the platform in the real world (that is, the platform is considered to be, in the real world, wherever it's reference point is).

The position of the reference point is not explicitly entered in Echoview, but all other positions are entered relative to it, wherever it may be.

Please note that the positive Z direction is downwards when the X-Y plane is horizontal (considered to be on a rigid platform that does not pitch and roll).

For many applications, such as a typical ship based echo integration survey with multiple downward looking transducers, the only aspect of transducer geometry required is the definition of transducer depth (http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Using_Echoview/About_transducer_draft.htm[draft]), if desired. Other applications, such as multiple frequency TS techniques, surveys with non-vertical transducers, and applications that require the position of samples to be precisely located in the world, Echoview's transducer geometry settings allow full specification of the transducer set up.

Echoview transducer geometry settings allow enough information to be stored about the location and orientation of transducers and GPS antennas to determine the geographic coordinates of any sample or single target in the acoustic beam - given the assumption of a stable platform with no pitch and no roll. In Echoview, some data formats may support roll data or roll and pitch data. For further information regarding relevant data formats and the effects of using roll and pitch data see http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Files,_filesets_and_variables/Variables/About_roll_data.htm[About roll data] and http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Files,_filesets_and_variables/Variables/About_pitch_data.htm[About pitch data].

Note: Transducer geometry calculations are not used in Echoview for calculating the geographic position of lines (and hence bathymetric data). Bottom picks are assumed to be at the position of the GPS antenna even if the beam is pointing at some angle to the vertical and the transducer is offset from the Reference point.

*About transducer location*

The relative location of the water level and GPS antenna and the location of each transducer are defined on the http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Windows_and_Dialog_Boxes/Dialog_Boxes/Transducer_Properties_dialog_box.htm#Location_page[Location page] of the http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Windows_and_Dialog_Boxes/Dialog_Boxes/Transducer_Properties_dialog_box.htm[Transducer Properties dialog box].

Locations are all defined relative to a system reference point. The system reference point may be any point defined relative to the transducer platform (it is not defined explicitly in Echoview, the locations of transducers, GPS antenna and water level are defined relative to it).

The coordinate system utilises three axes (X, Y and Z) and their orientation depends upon whether the platform is fixed or mobile.

*Fixed Platform*

The location of the system reference point is specified in geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude and altitude).

* The X axis is defined to run south-north (positive northwards, negative southwards)
* The Y axis is defined to run west-east (positive eastwards, negative westwards)
* The Z axis is defined to run vertically (positive downwards, negative upward)

*Mobile Platform*

The geographic location (latitude, longitude and altitude) of the GPS antenna is measured by a Global Positioning System (GPS) device. The location of the GPS antenna relative to the system reference point is specified in X, Y, Z coordinates (m). Hence the geographic location of the system reference point and the location of the face of each transducer can be determined in geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude and altitude) from the known position of the GPS antenna.

* The X axis is defined to run alongship (positive towards the bow, negative towards the stern)
* The Y axis is defined to run athwartship (positive towards starboard, negative towards port)
* The Z axis is considered to run vertically (positive downwards, negative upwards)

To determine the geographic location of a sample point or a single target in geographic coordinates it is also necessary to define the orientation of the transducer.

*About transducer orientation*

Transducers are not only located, but also oriented - that is, they point somewhere. Like location, orientation requires three parameters to be specified, in this case angles rather than coordinates. The orientation for each transducer is defined on the http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Windows_and_Dialog_Boxes/Dialog_Boxes/Transducer_Properties_dialog_box.htm#Orientation_page[Orientation page] of the http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Windows_and_Dialog_Boxes/Dialog_Boxes/Transducer_Properties_dialog_box.htm[TransducerProperties dialog box].

The X-Y-Z axes as defined above are taken as a reference for orientation. In summary:

[cols=",",]
|===
a|*For fixed platforms:*

* The X axis runs south-north
* The Y axis runs west-east
* The Z axis runs up-down

a|*For mobile platforms:*

* The X axis runs stern-bow
* The Y axis runs port-starboard
* The Z axis runs up-down
|===

Two angles are used to define the direction in which the acoustic axis is pointing (either elevation and azimuth angles or alongship and athwartship angles). A third angle called the rotation defines the direction of the http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Reference/Glossary.htm#Minor-axis[minor axis] of the transducer relative to a vertical plane passing through the http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Reference/Glossary.htm#beam_axis[beam axis]. The rotation of the transducer can only be determined after the definition of the beam direction.

*Elevation and Azimuth*

The angles are defined as follows:

* *Elevation* is the angle between the beam axis and the positive Z axis. +
 +
Valid range is 0° to 180°.

[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |defines a vertically downward pointing beam
|90° |a horizontal beam
|180° |a vertically upward pointing beam
|===

* *Azimuth* is the angle between the beam axis and the positive X axis (measured clockwise when viewed in the positive Z direction). +
 +
Valid range is 0° to 360° .

[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |defines a northward (or forward) pointing beam
|90° |eastward (or starboard) pointing
|180° |southward (or aft) pointing
|270° |westward (or port) pointing
|===

If the elevation is 0° or 180° then Azimuth is equivalent to a rotation.

*Along and Athwartship (Mobile Platform only)*

The angles are defined as follows:

* *Alongship* is the angle between the beam axis and the Y-Z plane. +
 +
Valid range is -180° to 180° .

[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |defines a downward pointing beam in the Y-Z plane
|-90° |a horizontal aft pointing beam
|90° |a horizontal forward pointing beam
|-180° |an upward pointing beam in the Y-Z plane
|180° |an upward pointing beam in the Y-Z plane
|===

* *Athwartship* is the angle between the beam axis and the X-Z plane.  +
 +
Valid range is -180° to 180° .

[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |defines a downward pointing beam in the X-Z plane
|-90° |a horizontal port pointing beam
|90° |degrees a horizontal starboard pointing beam
|-180° |an upward pointing beam in the X-Z plane
|180° |an upward pointing beam in the X-Z plane
|===

*Note:* Not all combinations of Alongship and Athwartship angle are valid. If one angle defines a downward pointing beam (-90° to 90°) and the other an upward pointing beam (-180° to -90° or 90° to 180°)  they cannot be describing the same direction!

*Rotation*

* *Rotation* is the angle between the positive http://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Reference/Glossary.htm#Minor-axis[minor-axis] of the transducer and the vertical plane running through the beam axis (measured in the clockwise direction as seen from the transducer).

Valid range is 0° to 360°.
[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |an upward pointing positive minor-axis
|180° |a downward pointing positive minor-axis
|===

*In Summary*

To determine the three coordinates defining the beam orientation do the following:

. Determine the pointing direction of the beam axis
+
Use your choice of either elevation-azimuth angles or alongship-athwartship angles.
. Determine the rotation angle of the transducer
+
Remember that the zero reference for the rotation angle is the vertical plane running through the beam axis and therefore that the rotation coordinate can only be meaningfully determined after you have defined the orientation of the beam axis.

*Examples:*

* A transducer beam pointing to starboard at an angle of 45 degrees with the positive minor axis of the transducer pointing forward is defined by either: +
 +
elevation = 45° , azimuth = 90° , rotation = 270° +
 +
-OR- +
 +
alongship = 0° , athwartship = 45° , rotation = 270° +
 

* A transducer beam pointing to port at an angle of 45 degrees with the positive minor axis of the transducer pointing forward is defined by either: +
 +
elevation = 45° , azimuth = 270° , rotation = 90° +
 +
-OR- +
 +
alongship = 0° , athwartship = -45° , rotation = 90°

*Notes:*

* You may define the pointing direction of the transducer with whichever pair of angles is most convenient for your application but the rotation angle will be the same, whichever pair of angles you choose to define the pointing direction.

* For a transducer with an elevation of 0° (that is, vertically downward pointing), the azimuth angle is logically equivalent to the transducer rotation. Echoview does not adjust the rotation angle on the dialog if you specify an azimuth without any elevation. We recommend, for clarity, that you do not use a non-zero azimuth with a zero elevation.

[appendix]
== Beam geometry

This Appendix was reproduced with permission from the Echoview 5.1 help file (see also http://www.echoview.com[www.echoview.com])

Echoview uses three axes in describing beam geometry: beam axis, minor axis and major axis. Range from the transducer is measured along the beam axis and position in the beam is measured from the beam axis (along the minor and major axes). Minor and major are axis naming conventions, and different manufacturers have adopted different naming conventions for the two axes. Equivalent axis terminology for leading brands of echosounders are:

== Revisions

*Version 1.04. 21^st^ August 2014*

Added new category of attributes, 'data' which describe the data type being stored and its dimensions (i.e. cell size).

Altered obligations on attributes from Mandatory (M) or Mandatory if Applicable (MA) to recommended (R) for ship_breadth, ship_tonnage, ship_engine_power, ship_noise_design and ship_acknowledgements.

Changed term data_processing_transceiver_gain to data_processing_on_axis_gain

Changed term data_processing_transceiver_gain_units to data_processing_on_axis_gain_units

Minor edits to improve readability in "`Purpose of this document`" section.

Added new attribute of "`Convention`" to the Metadata category.

*Version 1.10. 10^th^ May 2016.*

The ICES Data Centre (Hjalte Parner, Nils Olav Handegard) are constructing an Acoustic Trawl Survey database with the intention of implementing the ICES Acoustic Metadata Standard. Through this process a number of new and existing attribute fields were discussed. This revision documents the consequent changes that were made as described below.

*Add:* Category: Cruise attributes: cruise_summary_report attribute.

*Add:* Category: Ship attributes: ship_platform_code using ICES database

*Add:* Category: Ship attributes: ship_platform_class using ICES database

*Add:* Category: Data processing: data_processing_triwave_correction

Minor edits to wording of Category Mooring: mooring_uplimit, mooring_downlimit, mooring_z_units.

Minor edits to wording of Category Transect: transect_uplimit, transect_downlimit, transect_z_units.

Minor edits to wording of Category Dataset: uplimit, downlimit and z_units.

*Add:* Category: Metadata record: convention_version

Revised convention version. Previous versions were using a decimal number series - e.g. version 1.01, 1.02 etc. limiting the minor number series to 99 revisions. This revision alters the convention to follow the more common convention in the computer world where the version number is described by two integers separated by a full stop. Thus following this convention our previous version 1.05 would now be version 1.5, that is the 5^th^ revision in version 1 series. This version 1.10 is the 10^th^ revision of the version 1 series.

*Revised:* Category: Data attributes: data_range_axis_interval to data_range_axis_interval_type for consistency with attribute for vertical dimeionsion: data_ping_axis_interval_type.

*Add:* Category: Data attributes: data_range_axis_interval_value
